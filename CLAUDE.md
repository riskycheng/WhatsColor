# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

WhatsColor is an iOS game app that implements a "Mastermind" style color-guessing puzzle game with a retro handheld device aesthetic. The app features multiple game modes, themes, and a sophisticated UI that simulates a physical gaming device.

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
```bash
# Generate Xcode project from project.yml
xcodegen

# Build the app (after opening in Xcode)
# Use Xcode UI or command line:
xcodebuild -project WhatsColor.xcodeproj -scheme WhatsColor -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### Project Generation
The project uses XcodeGen for project file management. The `project.yml` file defines:
- Target configuration for iOS 15.0+
- Bundle identifier: `com.whatscolor.app`
- Asset and resource management
- Swift 5.9 configuration

## Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
The app follows a clear MVVM architecture:
- **Models**: `GameModels.swift` contains all data structures (`GameColor`, `GameStateModel`, `GameRowModel`, etc.)
- **ViewModels**: `GameViewModel.swift` is the central state manager handling game logic, timer, UI state
- **Views**: Multiple SwiftUI views in `Sources/Views/` for different UI components

### Key Components

#### GameViewModel (Central State Manager)
- Manages game state, timer, drag interactions
- Handles two game modes: Solo (advanced/deterministic) and Dual (beginner/custom)
- Coordinates between multiple dialog states and UI flows
- Implements sophisticated drag-and-drop logic with position tracking
- Manages theme switching and persistent level progression

#### Game Flow Architecture
1. **Start Screen** → **Settings Dialog** (Dual mode) → **Secret Code Selection** → **Game Play**
2. **Start Screen** → **Direct Game Play** (Solo mode with predetermined sequences)

#### Theme System
- Multiple visual themes with icon asset management
- Complex asset loading system that handles bundle path variations
- Icons organized in folders: `pixel_fruit`, `cute_cat`, `cute_dog`, `nice_fastfood`, `nice_fruit`, `nice_vegitables`
- Fallback mechanisms for missing assets

#### Drag & Drop System
- Sophisticated coordinate-based drag system with frame registration
- Supports dragging from color palette and between slots
- Visual feedback with drag overlays and target highlighting
- Intelligent auto-advance logic after color placement

### Data Models

#### Core Enums
- `GameColor`: 7 colors with hex values and UI representations
- `FeedbackMode`: Beginner (positional hints) vs Advanced (aggregate hints)
- `GameDifficulty`: Easy/Normal/Hard with different time limits
- `GameTheme`: Multiple visual themes with asset mappings

#### Game State
- `GameStateModel`: Central state container
- Persistent level progression per difficulty
- Fixed slot system for advanced gameplay strategies

## Key Development Patterns

### State Management
- Single source of truth in `GameViewModel`
- Published properties for SwiftUI reactivity
- Explicit state transitions with animation support
- Timer management with proper lifecycle handling

### UI Coordination
- Dialog overlay system with blur effects
- Complex gesture handling for drag operations
- Frame registration system for precise drop targeting
- Toast notification system with auto-dismissal

### Game Logic
- Deterministic secret code generation for Solo mode
- Advanced feedback calculation (aggregate vs positional)
- Intelligent auto-advance cursor logic
- Fixed slot system for strategic gameplay

### Asset Management
- Theme-based icon loading with multiple fallback strategies
- Bundle path debugging and diagnostics
- Support for both folder references and flattened assets
- Pixel-perfect rendering for pixel art themes

## Testing and Debugging

The app includes extensive bundle diagnostics in `GameViewModel.init()` that logs asset loading issues. When working with themes or assets, check the console output for path resolution details.

## Prototype Reference

The `prototype/` folder contains a JavaScript/HTML version that served as the initial design reference. This helps understand the core game mechanics and UI layout concepts that were translated to the native iOS implementation.
